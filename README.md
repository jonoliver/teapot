# I'm a teapot

When you absolutely, positively GOT to have a :interrobang: [teapot response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418), accept no substitutes. :tea: :tea:

# Usage

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
````

:notes: If you want tea forever, you gotta give proper creds:

```
curl http://localhost:9999 -H "User-Agent: teadrinker" -v
```

The user agent never lies.

# Why?

That is the [question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life), [no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality)?
